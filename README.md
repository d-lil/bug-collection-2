  ![about me](./src/components/images/phome.png)
  ```md
  This is the home page/about me. You just read it, if you feel like it.
  ```
  ![portfolio](./src/components/images/pport.png)
  ```md
  This is my portfolio page showing previous projects.
  ```
  >Some of the projects are spun down and don't open or are through the terminal only, so the "Deploy" link won't work for all of them.

  ![contact](./src/components/images/pcontact.png)
  ```md
  This is where you would be able to contact me from, but it isn't connected to a mailto, so it is just there to look pretty for now.
  ```
  ![resume](./src/components/images/presume.png)
  ```md
  This page contains a link where my resume can be downloaded to your page and saved for future reference *wink wink*
  ```
